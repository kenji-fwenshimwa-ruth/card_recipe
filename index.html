<h1>Meat Pie</h1>


<article style="font-size:20px ;">Besides the pavlova, there is probably no food more quintessentially Kiwi than the meat pie. <br>
    Meat pies are a European invention, with roots going back to ancient Greece and Rome. <br> 
    Pastry shells made by combining flour and water were filled with meat and cooked under coals. <br>
    The wealthier you were, the better the meat you had to fill your pie. <br> Some Romans even served seafood pies during dinner.

<h2>HOW TO PREPARE MEATPIE</h2>
<h3>To Make The Dough</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In a shallow mixing bowl, add flour, salt, sugar (if using) and butter</li>
    <li>Rub together till all turn to crumbs</li>
    <li>Add 100 ml of water and mix till all is combined.</li>
    <li>If the dough still needs water add a tablespoon of water at a 
        time till you get well combined dough</li>
    <li>Set dough aside in a cool place or a fridge for 30 minutes then you move on to preparing the meaty filling.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-style:italic ; color:blue;">Yes! Making the dough is that easy but remember, DO NOT overwork it when handling.</p>

<h3>To make the yummy pie filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Place a pan on medium heat and add oil, heat for 2 minutes, add chopped onions and fry till onion is translucent.</li>
    <li>Add mince to the onion and stir mince till its
        brown then add curry powder, thyme, stock cube, a pinch of salt and stir till all combine.</li>
    <li> Reduce the heat if need be to avoid burning.</li>
    <li>The fat from the mince should make the sauce juicy but if it looks dry, add a cooking spoon (100ml) of water to it.</li>
    <li>Add boiled potatoes and carrots, combine well and cook on a low heat for another 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>The mince should be well cooked now. Now you move on to thickening the mince.</li>
    <li>Add 2tbsp of flour to a bowl and mix with water to form a paste. Add the paste to the mince meat on 
        the heat and combine well.</li>
    <li>Leave to cook for another minute. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rolling the dough and making the meat pie</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Preheat oven at 180C/350F</li>
    <li>Break the egg into a bowl, whisk and set aside</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a bit of flour on a plain, clean surface</li>
    <li>Divide dough into 2 or 3 places and roll out flat using a rolling pin</li>
    <li>Place a circle cutter on the flat dough and cut out into many circles you can get. </li>
    <li>Repeat this process with the rest of the dough</li>
    <li>Add the meat filling to the centre of the circled dough, brush one half of the circle with whisked 
        egg and carefully fold over the meat filling making sure the 2 edges touch one another.
    (The aim of the egg is to seal the dough.)</li>
    <li>Close edges by pressing down with the tip of a fork</li>
    <li>Repeat this process for the remaining dough and filling. Place a foil in a baking tray and rub with oil
        (this stops the pie from sticking to the tray when done.)</li>
    <li>After you have completely filled the pastry, set on a baking tray, egg wash the top and pinch with a fork</li>
    <li>Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes at 180C⁰/350F</li>

    </ul>
